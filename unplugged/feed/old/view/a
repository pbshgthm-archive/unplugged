{"title":"How Delta and Alessi Brought High Design to 30,000 Feet","content":"<div><article id=\"start-of-content\" class=\"content link-underline relative body-copy\">\n\n\t\t\t<p>Next month, passengers in Delta&#x2019;s premium cabins will be among the first to experience the carrier&#x2019;s remarkable&#x2014;yes, remarkable&#x2014;new wine glass.</p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s hefty, but not as heavy as the original. The piece descends from Ronan and Erwan Bouroullec&#x2019;s &#x201C;Ovale&#x201D; range. First created for Alessi, the esteemed Italian design house, the brothers&#x2019; original design featured a solid base that weighed too much for in-air use. To adapt the glass for Delta, Alessi had to shave some ounces.</p>\n<p>The company&#x2019;s first move was to hollow out the base, but this made the glass less stable. To compensate, the company widened the base. But in doing so, it saw an opportunity&#x2014;a chance to modify the design so that it nestled more closely against inverted glasses of the same shape. Artists and mathematicians call this precise form of interlocking tessellation. Airlines love it when things (<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2015/07/hey-look-nightmarish-idea-plane-seating-ever/\">and people</a>) tesselate, because it means they can store more of them in tighter quarters. And Alessi&#x2019;s glasses tesselate beautifully. The eminently packable vessels hold just as much wine as Delta&#x2019;s old ones, but require 33 percent less room to store. Rumor has it Delta will use the extra space to accommodate a new line of martini glasses later this year. Cheers to geometry.</p>\n<p>Delta&#x2019;s clever new wine glass belongs to an extensive new line of dishes, cutlery, glassware, ceramics, and other serviceware designed in collaboration with Alessi. The collection, which is gorgeous, will appear in the airline&#x2019;s premium cabins beginning April 1. That&#x2019;s great news if you can afford it. But even if you can&#x2019;t, Alessi&#x2019;s brilliant designs say a lot about the state of the airline industry&#x2014;including why your experience at the back of the plane kind of sucks.</p>\n<h3>RASM and CASM</h3>\n<p>Delta carries more than 180 million passengers a year, but only some 25 million will have occasion to lift one of Alessi&#x2019;s strategically weighted wine glasses to their lips. Why invest in a fancy new line of serviceware that most of your customers will never use?</p>\n<p>Simple: Airlines make more money off the premium cabins than the cheap seats. The business of flying is the difference between Revenue per Available Seat Mile&#x2014;RASM&#x2014;and Cost per Available Seat Mile, or CASM. &#x201C;RASM in the front, CASM in the back,&#x201D; says aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia. &#x201C;Basically, if your CASM is higher than your RASM you lose. Vice versa, you survive. You can even make money.&#x201D; You maximize RASM on the seats at the front of the plane, so the blankets in first class feel like blankets; cut CASM in economy, where the blankets feel like something you peeled off a dryer&#x2019;s lint screen.</p>\n<p>International carriers have been investing in first-class tableware for years. Singapore Airlines partnered with Givenchy, KLM with Marcel Wanders, and Finnair with Marimekko and Iittala. But it&#x2019;s a perk most Americans are unaccustomed to&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s the point.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Establishing a point of difference is becoming key to building brand loyalty,&#x201D; says Jonny Clark, founder of trade publication TheDesignAir. America&#x2019;s legacy carriers used to distinguish themselves with lay-flat seats, all-aisle access, and dine-on-demand. Today it&#x2019;s brand partnerships. &#x201C;On Delta, passengers can expect Heavenly Bedding from Westin, while those flying on United can expect Saks Fifth Avenue for custom bedding,&#x201D; Clark says.</p>\n<h3>High Design at 30,000 Feet</h3>\n<p>The easy route for Alessi would have been to create slimmer, smaller versions of popular items from its catalogue. And on a superficial level, that&#x2019;s what the company did; of the 86 items in the Delta collection, the majority are svelte renditions of hallmark Alessi products. The shapely glass carafes are descended from Italian designer Stefano Giovanni&#x2019;s &#x201C;Mami&#x201D; line. The stainless steel servingware is based on Spanish architect Patricia Urquiola&#x2019;s &#x201C;Orloff&#x201D; range. The wine carafe&#x2014;a seemingly haphazard yet unaccountably attractive jumble of metal sticks&#x2014;was inspired by the &#x201C;Blow Up&#x201D; series of containers by Brazilian designers Humberto and Fernando Campana. All of Alessi&#x2019;s nips and tucks were approved, and in some case suggested, by the original designers.</p>\n<p>If all that seems like it&#x2019;s bound to increase CASM, well, it does. &#x201C;Cost savings was not an objective of this initiative,&#x201D; says Beatriz Sims, the carrier&#x2019;s head of international product development. When I press her about the punishing realities of airline economics, she politely redirects the conversation to highlight, in PR-friendly terms, the collection&#x2019;s modern, stylish, and functional design. The phrase &#x201C;uncompromising level of elegance and service&#x201D; comes up more than once. In truth, discussing Delta&#x2019;s fancy new tableware with Sims and other executives feels a lot like talking to John Hammond about <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2GHXKYKKi4\">the extravagancies of Jurassic Park</a>. <em>The new Alessi collection? Absolutely&#xA0;spectacular design; spared no expense.</em></p>\n<p>The first bit is true; Alessi&#x2019;s in-flight designs are every bit as stunning as the company&#x2019;s ground-bound wares. But Delta still imposed plenty of restrictions. &#x201C;It was important that the items look beautiful, but we also had to focus on space and weight reduction,&#x201D; says Alberto Alessi, the company&#x2019;s president. Alessi&#x2019;s designers had to not only improve the form and function of the airline&#x2019;s existing serviceware, they also had to fit their new collection inside the carrier&#x2019;s standard-issue service carts.</p>\n<p>To figure that out, Alessi turned to a different set of experts: flight attendants. Over the course of dozens test flights last year, Delta collected feedback from the people who have to carry all this stuff to your seat. Their input led to several improvements: A subtle, non-slip surface on the meal trays. A new teaspoon that rests stably atop the in-flight saucer, to ease single-handed delivery.</p>\n<p>The dishware is especially good. Alessi manufactured Delta&#x2019;s plates from bone china instead of stoneware, to make them thinner, and made their shapes more stackable. It even hid little feet on the plates&#x2019; undersides, to make them easier to collect after meals.</p>\n<p>In the end, all but a handful of the designs turned out lighter than the Alessi originals. But the new cutlery, for example&#x2014;while lighter than the Bouroullec brothers&#x2019; original design&#x2014;is still markedly heavier than Delta&#x2019;s previous utensils. &#x201C;From a passenger&#x2019;s point of view, what matters most is how the product feels, so it&#x2019;s important preserve their weight,&#x201D; Alberto Alessi says. &#x201C;These are objects the passenger actually picks up&#x2014;increasing their size and weight gives them a more premium feel.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>By shaving as much weight as possible from ceramics and serving trays (10 and 13 percent, respectively), the company could keep the cutlery&#x2014;and the wine glasses&#x2014;relatively hefty. A fully loaded meal tray now weighs just 1.5 percent less than Delta&#x2019;s original configuration. That won&#x2019;t save the airline millions of dollars a year, but it could win over high-paying customers who place a subconscious premium on substantial silverware.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</article></div>","author":"Robbie Gonzalez","date_published":"2017-03-14T14:15:19.000Z","lead_image_url":"https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/BU161124A_622-1200x630-e1489430050986.jpg","dek":null,"next_page_url":null,"url":"https://www.wired.com/2017/03/delta-alessi-brought-high-design-30000-feet/","domain":"www.wired.com","excerpt":"Alessiâ€™s gorgeous designs say a lot about the state of airlines, and why your experience at the back of the plane still kind of sucks.","word_count":1097,"direction":"ltr","total_pages":1,"rendered_pages":1}
