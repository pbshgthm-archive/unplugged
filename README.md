An interest based social network. The project is in its alpha phase right now. 

### About
- The model:
Please see the following Entity Relationship diagram to understand the data model:
https://www.gliffy.com/go/share/schq64urockyd4rnuhic

- The controllers:
There are four major blueprint instances corresponding to routes related to feed, articles, profile, etc.

- The view:
We have very few HTML pages that are either rendered using render_template, or data is brought with jquery calls.



### Prerequisites
Please download the latest versions of the following software to run this project:
```
Flask
Flask sqlalchemy
Request
Urllib
Beautiful soup
```
You will need to use ```Python-2```.
Hence, it is highly recommended that you work in a python virtual environment, so that newer versions
of python, in case they are installed, will not mess with the working.

## Deployment

Once you clone the project, and install the above libraries, just do:
```
python run.py
```
to see it run.

## Built With

* [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) - The web framework used
